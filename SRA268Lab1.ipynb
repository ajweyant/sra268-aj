April is usually the month that has the most precipitation, but January is known for the amount of snow that falls during the month. The two weeks could be very similar or different based off my prior knowledge, but I think April will have more precipitation. "

The average precipitation for January was 0.074 inches, while the average for April was 0.29 inches. My prediction was correct in that April will have a higher average precipitation. \n"
